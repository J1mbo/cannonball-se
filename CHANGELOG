CannonBall-SE Change Log

== v1.1 ==

1. Removed dependency on Boost, reducing the disk space required to compile CannonBall-SE.
2. To support use on single-core Pi's e.g. Pi-1 and Pi-Zero(W) (see below):
2.1 Reinstated original resolution (320x224) mode.
2.2 Added scalar fallbacks to Blargg filter (to enable use on CPUs without SIMD).
2.3 Automatically detects when operating on a single-core Pi and selects optimised settings at launch.
3. Performance improvements in critical parts (hwsprites, hwtiles, hwroad).
4. Added option to use F10 as master break key instead of Escape
5. Bug fixes:
5.1 Ghost cars no longer appear briefly on the players road when approaching checkpoints.
5.2 Trapped out-of-bounds write at launch in OTraffic::update_props()
5.3 Resolved overflow in calculation in OTiles::h_scroll_tilemaps()
5.4 Resolved potential seg fault when going from game to menu caused by unsafe sound subsystem reinitialisation in OSoundInt::init().
5.5 Resolved potential seg fault on changes requiring video restart due to free of ROM data on initial video subsystem initialisation.
5.6 Settings are now saved when selecting Enhanced or Original in Menu, Game Modes.

== v1.0 ==

1. Added OpenGL interface module to add support for shaders without needing SDLgpu.
2. Heavily revised the sound module to include MP3 audio playback.

== Older ==

1. Added CRT effect using customised version of Blargg's NTSC filter optimised for ARM NEON
2. Added CRT effect settings to settings menu
3. Added GLSL shader support using SDLgpu
4. Added some multi-threading to improve performance on Pi2/3/4
5. Fixed hang on high-score screen
