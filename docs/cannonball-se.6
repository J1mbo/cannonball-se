.SH GETTING STARTED
The following assumes that the game was downloaded and built in your home directory as ~/cannonball-se.
.PP
To run cannonball, copies of the original arcade ROMs are needed (more info in the ROMs section below) - copy these to ~/cannonball/roms before proceeding.
.PP
To start the game, "cd ~/cannonball-se" then "build/cannonball-se".

.SH CONTROLS
The default keyboard controls are:
.RS

.RE
.PP
These can also be changed within the game (menu, settings, controls, redefine keys).

.SH STEERING WHEELS
Steering wheels, joysticks and gamepads can be setup in the game (menu, settings, controls, redefine gamepad).

.SH ROMS
CannonBall needs a copy of the OutRun 'revision B' romset to function. These should be copied to the roms subdirectory
(usually ~/cannonball/roms). Please see the file roms.txt for file names and other information.
.PP
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP Users of CannonBall (and CannonBall-SE) are expected to own licensed copies of the original arcade ROMs that
are needed for the program to function. The use of ROM images may be restricted by copyright or other laws depending on jurisdiction.
The end-user assumes all responsibility in respect of the use of original ROMs.

.SH CUSTOM MUSIC
.PP
As well as the three seminal tracks provided in the Outrun ROMs, CannonBall-SE supports custom music playback via .WAV and .MP3
files. These can be used to replace the built-in music, or to add additional tracks to the list on the radio screen at the start of
the game. To use this feature, simply copy your music tracks in .WAV or .MP3 format to the res directory, and name them as:
.PP
[01–99]_Track_Display_Name.[wav|mp3|ym] - e.g. 04_AHA_Take_On_Me.mp3
.PP
Indexes 01–03 will replace the built‑in tracks (01=Magical Sound Shower), and indexes 04 and higher will add tracks to the list.
To ensure compatibility, set the game to 44.1kHz sample rate in config.xml (this is the default) and ensure your files are
also 44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo.

.SH FUNCTIONALITY
.PP
CannonBall-SE is tailored for use in homemade arcade cabinets. On top of the game port provided by CannonBall, CannonBall-SE provides:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Video-processing enhancements - an accurate NTSC filter (Blargg's SNES library), subtle screen curvature effect, analogue noise,
shadow mask effect, and a smooth bezel mask.
.IP \(bu 2
Enhanced audio module that provides consistent, pop-free audio and custom music via MP3 playback.
.IP \(bu 2
Enhanced rumble support for compatible steering wheels (rumbles on tyre smoke).
.IP \(bu 2
Performance enhacements and automatic frame rate selection.
.IP \(bu 2
Play count and 'machine hours' tracking (menu, about).
.IP \(bu 2
Various stablity and bug fixes.

.SH CHOOSING A PLATFORM
.PP
Cannonball-SE has been optimised to run on RaspberryPi boards with RaspberryPi OS, and also runs on any Intel/AMD PC with SSE4
(probably all machines made since about 2010) with Ubuntu. All quad-core Pi's are supported. If you have a spare Pi, PC, or
laptop - it can probably run CannonBall-SE.
.PP
For most users, Pi4 is the sweet-spot with no overclocking needed to achive a 60fps and its 4 USB ports on-board providing
connectivity for a steering wheel, external amplifier/DSP, case fan, and a keyboard for diagnostics when needed.
.PP
The game switches dynamically between 30 and 60fps depending on system capability. Most systems will run at 60fps with all effects
enabled (the 'Full' shader) with standard dpi screens (1280x1024 to 1920x1080). For Pi2/Pi3 users (and assuming 1280x1024):
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Pi2 (v1.1): Solid 30fps will full shader at stock clocks. To try 60fps mode, overclock the board to 1050MHz CPU, 500MHz GPU,
500MHz SRAM and set in the game: Fast shader, Fast S16 Emulation, Overlay Mask, and 16ms sound callbacks.
.IP \(bu 2
Pi2 (v1.2), Pi3, and Pi-Zero2W: Solid 60fps with Fast shader at stock clocks. Set GPU to 400MHz to use Full shader.
.RE
.PP
Higher resolution screens will need more power. Any USB steering wheel should work - Thrustmaster Ferarri branded wheels are readily available on popular auction sites. When using any Pi board, a CPU heatsink is required (larger the better).
.PP
.SH STUTTERING AUDIO
.PP
There are two potential causes of stuttering audio:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
The Pi USB stack is known to be problematic with USB audio devices (see
<http://www.raspyfi.com/anatomy-of-a-pi-usb-audio-quality-and-related-issues-on-pi/>). For Pi2, Pi3, and Pi-Zero2W users,
USB ports need to be put in 'full speed' mode when using external USB audio (add 'dwc_otg.speed=1' to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt).
Unforutnately, on Pi2 v1.2, Pi3 and Pi-Zero2W, this appears to prevent most USB keyboards working (though steering wheels are
generally OK). Workaround is to use a bluetooth keyboard or to SSH.
.IP \(bu 2
The system may struggle to keep up with the sound callback rate. This is most noticable on the Pi2 when using 60fps mode with the
analogue audio output. Fix is to switch the game from 8ms to 16ms callback (Menu/Settings/Sound/Music/Callback Rate).
.RE
.SH WATCHDOG SUPPORT
.PP
For systems with a hardware watchdog (including all RaspberryPi boards), CannonBall-SE hooks this so that the system will be automatically
rebooted if a hang occurs, for example due to aggressive overclocking.
