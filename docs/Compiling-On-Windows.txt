CannonBall-SE can be compiled under Windows, and the included CMake files automate most of this.

If you're unfamiliar with compiling on Windows, this guide should get you started.

Process:

1. Install Visual Studio 22 (VS), being sure to select "Desktop Development with C++" under "Workloads" in the installer.

2. Open VS, select "Clone a Respository", and enter "https://github.com/J1mbo/CannonBall-SE". Note where this will be
   saved to, shown in the 'Path' box (defaults to C:\Users\[username]\Source\Repos). Click Clone, and VS will download the
   source code directly from GitHub.

3. In the "Solution Explorer" pane on the right, VS should now show "Folder View" with the 'Path' from the previous step.
   Double-click on that to start the build. The CMake configuration take care of installing dependencies, which does take
   a while (about 20 minutes on my machine) and unfortuately, VS shows "Ready" in the bottom left corner throughout this
   process. It's not finished until you see in the Output window:

   1> CMake generation finsihed.

4. While CMake is running, find your ROMs and copy them into the 'roms' folder under the project path from step 2. e.g.:

   C:\Users\[username]\Source\Repos\CannonBall-SE\roms\
   
5. Once CMake is finished, ensure "windows-release" is selected in the drop-down next to "Local Machine", then click on the
   green play button just to it's right to compile.

6. Compiling doesn't take long and after that the game should start.

To compile a debug build, change the centre drop down to "windows-debug" and the drop down to it's right to:
"cannonball-se.exe (Debug\cannonball-se.exe). Then click the green play button to (re)compile.
