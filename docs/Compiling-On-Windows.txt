CannonBall-SE can be compiled under Windows, and the included CMake files automate most of this.

If you're unfamiliar with compiling on Windows, this guide should get you started.

Process:

1. Install Visual Studio 22 (VS), being sure to select "Desktop Development with C++" under "Workloads" in the installer.

2. Open VS, and select "Clone a Respository" and enter https://github.com/J1mbo/CannonBall-SE and note where this will be
   saved to, shown in the 'Path' box (defaults to C:\Users\[username]\Source\Repos)

3. VS will now download the source files and CMake will install the dependencies. This does take a while, about 20 minutes
   on my machine, and unfortuately, VS shows "Ready" in the bottom left corner throughout this process. It's not finished
   until you see in the Output window:

   1> CMake generation finsihed.

4. While CMake is running, find your ROMs and copy them into the 'res' folder under the project path from step 2. e.g.:

   C:\Users\[username]\Source\Repos\CannonBall-SE\res\
   
5. Once CMake is finished, ensure "windows-release" is selected in the drop-down next to "Local Machine", then click on the
   green play button just to it's right to compile.

6. Compiling doesn't take long and after that the game should start.

To compile a debug build, change the centre drop down to "windows-debug" and the drop down to it's right to:
"cannonball-se.exe (Debug\cannonball-se.exe). Then click the green play button to (re)compile.
