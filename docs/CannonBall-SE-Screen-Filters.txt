CannonBall-SE Screen Filters

Modern LCDs render OutRun's low-res graphics as oversized, razor-sharp pixels - making games feels clinical. CannonBall-SE recreates the vintage feel with a three-stage, CPU+GPU pipeline:

1. NTSC filtering (CPU)

The game's output is put through a SIMD-accelerated port of Blarggâ€™s NTSC filter, which softens the image and corrects the colours. When in 'Composite' mode, this also adds artifacts like shimmer & dot crawl (whilst not present on RGB arcade monitors, this reduction in fidelity improves the visuals for many players).

2. CRT shader (GPU)

The filtered image is then processed on GPU with a light-weight shader that adds barrel distortion and vignette to simulate the curved glass of arcade screens, along with light analog noise and a configurable shadow-mask grille effect visible in mid-tones.

3. Bezel & aperture overlay (GPU)

Finally an overlay is used to simulate the CRT bezel shape by fadeing the border softly, further enhancing the curved glass effect.


By leveraging multi-threading, SIMD, and GPU all in parrallel, CannonBall-SE hits 60 fps on a 32-bit Pi2 despite the weight of the processing.
