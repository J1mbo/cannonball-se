As of September 2025:

- Audio may not play after system restart. This is caused by the SDL device ordering
  changing on some systems at each boot. Future revision may include the option to select
  audio device by name to resolve this.
  
- Some steering wheels expose more buttons or controls than SDL can use, and in these cases
  some buttons or controls may not be recognised. A mapping entry is required in
  res/gamecontrollerdb.txt for affected devices.
