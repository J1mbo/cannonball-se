As of August-2025:

- 'Ghost' traffic flicks on screen when approaching checkpoints for 1 or maybe 2 frames,
  and it is possible to crash into these if you're unlucky. Unknown currently if this is
  an original SEGA code bug.

- Audio may not play after system restart. This is caused by the SDL device ordering
  changing on some systems at each boot. Future revision may include the option to select
  audio device by name to resolve this.
